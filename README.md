# IOS-Dev
The iOS component of the Ech0Cell project aims to provide an effective mobile application specifically designed for iPhone users. This application is specifically created to provide users with the ability to monitor and control their cellular data and network performance in real-time.

# How It Works
**1-Data Collection:**
The application gets several network and data use stats straight from the iOS system APIs. This includes the current signal strength, the rate at which data is being sent, and the kind of connection being used.

**2-Data Processing and Analysis:**
After collecting it, the data is then processed and evaluated inside the application. The application utilizes this data to provide valuable observations, such as patterns in data utilization and summaries of network performance.

**3-User Interaction:**
Users interact with the application by navigating through a sequence of user-friendly displays and tabs. The primary dashboard offers an extensive overview of network performance, while specialized sections provide more detailed analysis of data use and administration of settings.

**4-Notification System:**
The application utilizes the notification system of iOS to inform users about important changes and thresholds, such as approaching a data limit or detecting a substantial decrease in network velocity.

# Development and Contribution
The iOS version of Ech0Cell is constructed using the Swift programming language and utilizes current iOS development methodologies to guarantee maximum efficiency and compatibility with the most recent iOS versions.
